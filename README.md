# JSON-Based-Api-
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular language independent, data interchange format. JSON has significantly improved server-to-browser communications, especially when it comes to AJAX. Most of today's APIs return the response in JSON format as it is much easier to load, read and process JSON compared to XML, making it very popular.

Developed some applications :
1. Currency Converter : contacts a real-world API, collects the JSON data, and performs currency conversion.
2. BMI Calculator : contact an API which is designed on our own , collect the JSON response and then process it to get the result you want.

Coding for the Project:

Languages Used : JavaScript , JSON , PHP
